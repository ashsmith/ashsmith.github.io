I've been in to web development since I was 16. 6 years later I'm well-rounded in most areas of development from backend-development to sysadmin to front-end. I have reasonable experience in design, user experience and usability. 

My focus is on Magento development in particular, I aim to be a certified Magento developer by the end of June 2014.
