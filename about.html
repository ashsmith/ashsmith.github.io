<h1>About Me!</h1>

<p class="leading-text">
I've been working with Magento for 7 years, and a PHP developer for 8.
I'm well experienced in PHPUnit and writing code that is maintainable and well tested.
When I'm not behind the laptop I'll be out exploring on my bike, or taking part in a road race somewhere!
