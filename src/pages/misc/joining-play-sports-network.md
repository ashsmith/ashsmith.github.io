I'm super excited to say that next week I'll be starting my first day at [Play Sports Network][psn] as their Magento Developer. They are the company behind the biggest cycling YouTube channels: [Global Cycling Network (GCN)][gcn], [Global Mountain Biking Network (GMBN)][gmbn], and [Global Triathlon Network (GTN)][gtn] (Also: [GCN Tech][gcntech], [GMBN Tech][gmbntech], and [EMBN][embn]). 

We all love stats right? They have almost 4.5 million followers across social media, and 565 million lifetime video views! Equal to 4,757 years and 314 days amount of time people have spent watching their content. Not bad eh?!

Needless to say, I'm a huge fan of the channels. I've been following GCN for a number years, and the launch of GTN last year was much welcomed as I've recently been busy training for triathlon! As far as jobs go, I'd say this is pretty close to a dream job!

The main focus of my role will be on their stores which sell their branded merchandise such as team kits, and branded t-shirts, hoodies and sweatshirts.

Further to this, [SHIFT Active Media][shift] is their sister company, which is a full-service agency focusing on the best cycling brands in the business, so there's opportunity there to work with awesome brands too.


## Play Sports are hiring.
