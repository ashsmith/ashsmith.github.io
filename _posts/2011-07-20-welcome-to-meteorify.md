Welcome to Meteorify, a web design & development studio! Meteorify is currently run by myself, <a title="Ash Smith - Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/ashsmithco" target="_blank">Ash</a>. As a web designer and developer I provide you with cutting edge and fantastic web design to the ecommerce market specifically, I have been developing and designing e-commerce stores for many years and believe it&#8217;s time to offer my services to the public, with the dream to improve e-commerce sites from all across the web.

> I believe the user is the key to a great e-commerce store

I believe the user is the key to a great e-commerce store, when you put the user first and put the rest aside you can focus on their needs first, by building a website around your users they will feel engaged throughout their visit, and will be much more likely to not only purchase but to recommend to friends, including using social tools to promote their purchase. By doing this, your traffic and sales will increase a real winning combination.

Below are the services I currently offer to you:

## Consultancy

Meteorify will happily work for you as a professional consultancy. Experts in topics from User Experience, Web Hosting, Social Media, SEO and more, for full details please contact us.

## Regular Web Store Optimisation

On a regular basis, typically a monthly basis, I can offer my services to optimise your store. This involves a review of your store followed by my recommendations, which once approved by yourself I take the appropriate action to improve your store. After a month has passed I will follow up with a report which outlines how my changes have improved your conversion rate, site speed and social sharing.

## Web Hosting

Meteorify can, if required, provide your store a home on Meteorify&#8217;s servers, which are kept up to date with the latest security software, and is monitored daily by Meteorify. I take hosting an online store seriously, our servers are regularly tested to make sure they meet the specifications of PCI Data security standards. Your business is safe with Meteorify.

Meteorify&#8217;s servers are also highly tuned to host large volumes of stores, and handle massive amounts of traffic.

## Magento Store Speed Optimisation

There is no doubt Magento is a huge e-commerce system, it can be incredible slow on certain web hosts, which is why Meteorify offer an optimisation service for all those who are hosted on Meteorify&#8217;s servers.

## Search Engine Optimisation

Search engine optimisation or SEO is something so many businesses ignore, optimising your store for search engines is key, this is where a lot of your traffic will come from and being as high in the search results for your keywords is key (no pun intended) this is why Meteorify offers a SEO service, we make sure your store is highly optimised to be visible to the search engines and to gain those top spots.

Meteorify only ever use white-hate techniques to help you climb in the search engines, we are modest with our SEO work. One more thing about our SEO services, we believe SEO is extremely important and shouldn&#8217;t be abused and we will never let our SEO practices get in the way of a fantastic user experience.

## One last thing

When you hire Meteorify for any of the above services, Meteorify will never forget about your users, your users are the most important aspect to us. Everything we do revolves around your customers and them alone.

Thank you for reading, once again welcome to Meteorify.
