Recently I&#8217;ve been working on a new store which will be shipping internationally, and needed to set up all the tax rates within the EU, for this the client is deciding to stick to the UK&#8217;s 20% VAT rate. With this in mind I pulled together a quick CSV which you can download (here: <http://db.tt/TrrKtQgc>) and simply uploading within Magento by navigating to: **Sales** > **Tax** > **Import / Export Tax Rates**.

Hopefully this will help you speed up setting up multiple EU tax zones!
