We all love to stay as up to date and relevant as we possibly can. Sometimes this incredibly hard because of the shear amount of information there is to learn! However, these 11 blogs come from me and I swear by them and their content. They are fantastic resources for learning the latest trends in marketing & SEO, and E-commerce! So, prioritise these!

### 1) [Econsultancy][1]

Econsultancy is an amazing resource and seals the number one spot on my list. I read this blog daily, the information the authors share is invaluable and you can often get an insight as to how the big brands do their marketing campaigns.

### 2) [Shopify Blog][2]

Shopify write regularly about everything surrounding selling online, and that makes them great in so many ways. Not only is Shopify a fantastic hosted e-commerce CMS, they know what they&#8217;re talking about!

### 3) [SEOmoz][3]

SEOmoz isn&#8217;t just about SEO as you might think. They cover a wide range of topics, the main message is about making a usable and loveable website that gets you high in the search engines!

### And the rest!
